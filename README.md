# covid19-stats
This is an open-source project which helps to get info for differenet states in India on SARS-CoV-2. I started this project to help other people get more info on how virus is affecting in many areas. I've pushed this repo in it's nascent stage, however, I'm commited to push this further and beyond. It's currently hosted on Heroku.
I want to thank generous people at https://github.com/covid19india/covid19india-react for making this data available to public. For vaccination center details, I'm using API provided by Indian government. The link is here - https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin
Feel free to contribute and message me for any help. Thanks!
